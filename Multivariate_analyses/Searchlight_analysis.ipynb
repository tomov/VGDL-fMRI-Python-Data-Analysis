    "1. **Cog neuro assumes the brain is made up of functional units.** Based on the relevant unit of analysis (local regions). This idea about the brain as a modular structure comes from Cognitive Neuroscience.\n",
    "2. **Avoid overfitting.** From a statistical point of view, we prefer to have as few dimensions as possible. As such, we'd like to reduce the noise in our dataset by only including the most relevant voxels.\n",
